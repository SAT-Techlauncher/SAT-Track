# Developing a Semi-Automated Satellite Tracking System (Sat-Track)
This repository is for the semi-automated satellite tracking system project currently being run through the TechLauncher program at the Australian National University. 

As the number of deployed satellites continues to increase, so does the need to have efficient, accurate and reliable monitoring of said satellites. Currently there are existing services such as [CelesTrak](https://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/) that deliver various satellite's data such as position but they are not the whole picture. Our client requires more in depth data from these satellites and thus our project aims to allow them more efficient and accurate access to satellite data for spectrum analysis.

## Project Statement <a id="1"></a>
The SAT-Track project aims to provide a method for successfully tracking overhead systems without reliance on foreign data. The intention is to develop a satellite tracking system which is able to identify various satellites via spectrum analysis, position, and travel. Additionally a statement of work has been developed in collaboration with our client.

## Project Stakeholders
This project was proposed by [Clearbox Systems](http://www.clearboxsystems.com.au/). Clearbox requires accurate and reliable satellite data to be readily available as they need it. Therefore this project will aid them in actively tracking satellites as they require. They are the sole stakeholder for this project and are also the only planned users.

## Project Software & Source <a id="2"></a>
As stated above the end product will be run on a local system within Clearbox Systems. To aid Clearbox users and potential new teammates we will maitain documentation on how to use this project.

## Project Documentation <a id="3"></a>
Our team aims to document our discussions during team and client meetings through the use of minutes. Both these seperate meetings will take place weekly. We also aim to maintain a decision log to track key development choices and a reflection log to document our learning as a team.

## Group Members & Workflow <a id="5"></a>
Our team consists of six members, all Australian National University students, who are completing degrees within Computer Science. For this project we divided the roles based on each members strengths but we plan to communicate often and are open to rotating roles should there be a need to do so. We manage tasks via Trello and evaluate and re-evaluate tasks at weekly meetings to manage progress. We also use Slack to communicate with our client and between members.

We currently hold a team meeting via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) every Tuesday and a client meeting every Friday, also via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).
